/// File format description:
///
/// Every file starts with one FileHeader structure. It is followed by an arbitrary number of
/// records. That header gives you the size of the FileHeader and the size of the RecordHeader
/// structures used for all the following records.
///
/// Be careful that both FileHeader & RecordHeader structures may grow in the future, so that when
/// you read a file, you must use these given sizes to move around the file, while skipping possible
/// parts of the headers your code doesn't know about.
///
/// Each record starts with a RecordHeader structure, which provides sizes so that you can find
/// both the next and the previous record, and implicitly tells you the size of its raw byte blob.
///
/// Each RecordHeader a typeId, which tells us what handler knows how to manipulate this data. This
/// typeId is extremely important and must not collide between types!
///
/// The RecordHeader gives an instance id, in case multiple streams of data of the same type are
/// needed. Each RecordHeader is immediately followed by a blob of raw bytes, which meaning is only
/// known by the type handler.
///
/// The RecordHeader provides a record format version, to be interpreted by the type handler, so
/// that type handlers can handle changes in the format of their data.
///
/// The RecordHeader also provides a timestamp for the data, to be used when playing back the data,
/// as well as a Record::Type.

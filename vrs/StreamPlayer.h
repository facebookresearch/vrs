/// Class to handle data read from records of a VRS file, by attaching an instance to one or more
/// streams of a RecordFileReader. This base class is the bare-bones way to read VRS records.
/// Reading records is now probably better handled by the specialized RecordFormatStreamPlayer.
///
/// For each record, the stream player will be presented the record in a callback named
/// processXXXHeader(), which will tell if the record should be read by returning true, in which
/// case the callback is expected to set the provided DataReference to tell where the record's data
/// should be read. Upon completion of the read, the matching processXXX() callback will be
/// invoked, allowing the StreamPlayer to interpret/use the read data.

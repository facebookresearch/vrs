/// \brief Essential VRS class holding a record's details and payload in memory during creation.
///
/// Record are containers for data captured at a specific point in time (their timestamp).
///
/// Records can only be created using Recordable::createRecord(), and are then owned and managed
/// by the recordable's private RecordManager.
///
/// There are 3 types of user records: configuration, state and data records.
///
/// Configuration records are meant to describe how the device (or virtual device, such as an
/// algorithm), is configured: this could represent the resolution of a camera sensor, its
/// framerate, its exposure setting if it's fixed, etc. Whenever the configuration of a device
/// changes, a new configuration record should be generated. At the beginning of any recording,
/// a configuration record is also expected, and VRS itself might call a Recordable's
/// createConfigurationRecord() method to be sure a configuration record is created.
///
/// State records are meant to describe the internal state of the device or virtual device.
/// A camera might be configured in auto-exposure mode, so that the exposure of the camera might
/// evolve over time, based on the images recorded. Similarly, algorithms, in particular vision
/// algorithms, may have an internal state, and it might be useful to record that state.
/// However, we do not necessarily want to record every state change. The internal exposure of a
/// camera might change at every frame, and the potentially very large internal state of a
/// vision algorithm is also likely to change each time a sensor record is processed. Devices
/// with changing internal state are expected to generate state records, as necessary, but at a
/// controlled rate, so as to allow to reproduce replay conditions without generating an
/// overwhelming amount of data. Similarly to configuration records, State records might be
/// requested by VRS, by calling a Recordable's createStateRecord method.
///
/// Data records are used to capture the actual sensor data. Devices are expected to create Data
/// records whenever data is received from some kind of device driver, or arbitrarily in the
/// case of synthetic data.
///
/// See Recordable::createRecord() to see how to create records.

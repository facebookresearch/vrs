/// \brief The DataLayout class describes the data stored inside a DataLayoutContentBlock.
///
/// A DataLayout object is usually constructed using AutoDataLayout and AutoDataLayoutEnd helpers.
/// This method allows the easy & safe definition of a DataLayout in the form of a struct.
/// The member variables of an AutoDataLayout allow the easy access of the individual pieces of
/// content that make up a DataLayoutContentBlock, both for writing & reading.
///
/// Note that though DataLayout objects may look like structs, constructing them is relatively
/// expensive, and creating AutoDataLayout objects involve a synchronisation lock. Therefore, avoid
/// creating & destroying using short lived AutoDataLayout stack variables. Instead, prefer
/// allocating the DataLayout objects you will need frequently as member variables of other classes
/// that are long lived.
///
/// A DataLayout object can generate a json representation of itself, that is stored by VRS as an
/// internal tag of a VRS record stream. This json data will be used when reading the VRS file to
/// interpret the data of the corresponding DataLayoutContentBlock. The instantiation of a
/// DataLayout from a json message is meant for exclusive use by VRS itself, when reading a file.
/// VRS is very careful to only do this json expensive deserialization once per type.
///
/// The key feature of DataLayout is the separation of the layout description saved once per stream,
/// from the actual payload in each record, which can be minimal, containing only binary data.
/// The DataLayout sections of records are not stored in json format.
///
/// Most methods of this class are meant for exclusive use by VRS itself, even if they are public.
///
/// Anatomy of a DataLayout
/// =======================
///
/// A DataLayout is an ordered collection of individual pieces of data, all deriving from the
/// DataPiece abstract class. Classes deriving from DataPiece fall in two categories:
/// Fixed-size DataPiece objects, and variable-size DataPiece objects.
///
/// Fixed-size DataPiece objects, use the same number of bytes, no matter the actual value:
/// - single values of the supported POD types.
/// - fixed size arrays of the supported POD types.
///
/// DataLayout supports the following POD types:
/// - native C/C++ types, like int8, int16, int32, int64, signed or unsigned, float & double.
/// - Bool, which is a replacement for bool, because vector<bool> is not an STL container, see
///   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17794569/why-is-vectorbool-not-a-stl-container
/// - 2, 3 & 4 D points, 3 & 4 D matrices, of types int32, float & double, for instance:
///   Point2Df: a 2 dimension point using float.
///   Matrix4Dd: a 4 dimension matrix using double.
///
/// DataPieceValue<T> and DataPieceArray<T> are the two fixed size DataPiece template classes.
///
/// Note: You can not use DataLayout template types with your own POD types, because:
///  1. DataLayout needs a factory able to instantiate them, even when your code isn't around,
///  2. it would defeat the purpose of handling format changes, as any change made to your
///  POD type would have to be versioned & managed by hand.
///
/// Variable-size DataPiece objects use a number of bytes that depends on their actual value:
/// - DataPieceVector<T>: a vector of any of the supported POD types, or std::string.
/// - DataPieceStringMap<T>: a string map of any of the supported POD types, or std::string.
/// - DataPieceString: an ASCII or utf8 text string.
///
/// Internal representation (what you don't need to know unless you are working on DataLayout)
///
/// Because there is a known fixed number of fixed-size DataPiece objects, each of known size,
/// we can pre-allocate a buffer to hold the data values of all those DataPiece objects.
/// Fixed-size DataPiece objects reference their data using an offset and the size of their data.
/// All read & write value operations on fixed-size DataPiece objects use that buffer, so that
/// we can directly read from and write to disk that part of a DataLayout's data.
/// That buffer is the first section of the fixedData_ byte vector.
///
/// For variable-size DataPiece objects, because the DataPiece data has an unforeseeable size,
/// data reads & writes are not handled the same as for fixed-size DataPiece objects.
/// Variable-size DataPiece objects don't have setter methods, but "stage" methods, that set the
/// value in a field of the DataPiece object itself. The "stage" methods also allows to read the
/// staged values. Once the value of all the variable-size DataPiece objects are staged, the staged
/// values can be collected in a buffer, the varData_ byte vector. To interpret a variable size
/// buffer read from disk, we need an index, to know where each piece starts, and their size.
/// That's the variable size index. The size of that index is known ahead of time, since there is
/// one index entry per variable-size DataPiece, and we know up-front how many we have.
/// The index is stored in the fixedData_ vector, after the data of fixed-size DataPiece values.
/// The values of the index are set when the variable size data is collected.
/// When reading the value of a variable-size DataPiece, the varData_ buffer is used, if present.
///
/// To write a DataLayout section, the 3 following operations are needed:
///  1. collect the variable-size DataPiece values. That operations allocates the varData_ buffer,
///    and updates the var data index in the fixedData_ buffer.
///  2. write the fixedData_ buffer.
///  3. write the varData_ buffer.
///
/// Therefore, to read & write the data of a DataLayout from & to disk, there is no encoding of the
/// data, unlike with json, which guaranties the bit accuracy of your data.
/// That can be critically important when using float & double numbers.
///
/// Of course, all of this is the responsibility of VRS itself.

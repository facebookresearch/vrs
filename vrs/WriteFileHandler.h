/// \brief The WriteFileHandler interface adds write operations to the FileHandler interface.
///
/// There are two types of WriteFileHandler implementations. They might be able to:
/// - create files, which which case the create() API should be implemented.
/// - modify an existing file, in which case reopenForUpdates() gives write access.
/// Some class of cloud storage are immutable, hence the important distinction.
/// VRS' DiskFile offers the most comprehensive implementation, because it is designed to fit all
/// the needs of advanced VRS file creations, with chunking, but it should be perfectly usable
/// on its own. On the other hand, network WriteFileHandler implementations might have very specific
/// behaviors designed to accommodate the specificities of the network storage they implement.
/// In particular, they might have specific behaviors to handle VRS file creation in the cloud,
/// which requires the first part of the file to be edited last (and probably uploaded last too).
/// Therefore, network WriteFileHandler implementations might not be usable for anything else than
/// VRS file creation.

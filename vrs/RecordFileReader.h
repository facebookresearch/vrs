/// Recipe:
/// - open a VRS file using openFile().
/// - get info about the VRS file using getTags().
/// (optional: the writer may provide recording context info).
/// - find out which streams it contains using getStreams().
/// - attach record players to the streams you care about, using setStreamPlayer().
/// - playback records one-by-one using readRecord(), or all at once using readAllRecords().
/// - close the file.
/// State, configuration & data records handling is delegated to their stream id players.
/// Player can 'process' the data in the callback made by the file reader's thread,
/// or delegate the work by posting a PlaybackRecord to a PlaybackThread.

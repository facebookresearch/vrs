/// \brief The class to create VRS files.
///
/// There are different strategies to write a VRS file:
///
/// Write all the data of one or more recordables to a file synchronously in one shot:
///   - create a RecordFileWriter.
///   - add the (active) recordables you want to record using addRecordable().
///   - create all the records you want, as long as they fit in memory.
///   - call writeToFile() with a filepath.
///   - profit!
///
/// To write the data of one or more recordables, progressively, while records are being generated,
/// using a background thread:
///   - create a RecordFileWrite.
///   - add the (active) recordables you want to record using addRecordable().
///   - create the file using createFileAsync().This will create the file & write a few bytes,
///     but should be quite quick.
///   - optional: call purgeOldData() to discard records that were created before
///     what you really want to record.
///   - call writeRecordsAsync() regularly to write old enough records to disk in the background.
///     (very fast call)
///   - optional: call closeFileAsync() to write the remaining unwritten records, in the background.
///     (very fast call)
///   - call waitForFileClosed() to write all the unwritten records & wait for the file
///     to be written & closed. (blocking call).
///   - profit!

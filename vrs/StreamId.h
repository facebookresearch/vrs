/// \brief VRS stream type or class identifier enum.
///
/// Each stream in a VRS file has a type, represented by RecordableTypeId.
/// RecordableTypeId values represent a class of recordable, a particular logical or virtual
/// recordable, or a hardware specific recordable, using their specific record formats.
///
/// Initially, every recordable needed their own enum values. This was non-scalable way to identify
/// unique recordable types, and required every use case to have their own recordable type id in a
/// shared enum definition. This method is now deprecated.
///
/// Today, instead of creating new RecordableTypeId values for new devices, use an existing
/// "Recordable Class" ID (values between 200 and 999) along with a flavor to describe the data
/// being recorded in the stream.
///
/// Should none of the existing "recordable class" match your use case, please propose new ones.
///
/// Meta only: If you can not use a "recordable class" value with a "flavor" without having to
/// refactor a lot of code, you can still create new enum values, even if that's bad practice.
///
/// For each enum value, a proper description must be provided in StreamId.cpp
///

# What is in this folder?

The modules in `vrs/oss` are replacements for libraries that exist at Meta but
we aren't open sourcing at this point.

- `vrs/oss/aria` provides `DataLayout` definitions used by the Aria device.
- `vrs/oss/logging` provides a logging facility, that merely prints to `stdout`.
  When integrating VRS in your own code, you will probably want to redirect that
  logging output to your own logging infrastructure.

The other modules in `vrs/oss` may look a bizarre, because they are minimized
clones of the original, sometimes with a single definition. They are only used
for testing.

- `vrs/oss/portability` provides a single definition used for some tests only,
  and that weren't promoted into `vrs/os`.
- `vrs/oss/test_data` provides some sample files used for unit tests purposes
  only.
- `vrs/oss/test_helpers` and `vrs/oss/TestDataDir` provides helper functionality
  for unit tests.

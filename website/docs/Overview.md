VRS is a **file format** optimized to record & playback streams of sensor data, such as images, audio samples, and any other discrete sensors (IMU, temperature, etc), stored in per-device streams of time-stamped records.

VRS was first created to record images and sensor data from early prototypes of the Quest device, to develop the deviceâ€™s positional tracking system now known as [Insight](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/powered-by-ai-oculus-insight/), and Quest's hand tracking software. It is also the file format used by the [Aria glasses](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/).

## Main features
* VRS files contain multiple streams of time-sorted records generated by a set of "devices", typically one per stream.
* File and streams contain a set of "tags", which are a set of string name-value pairs, to describe them.
* Streams may contain `Configuration`, `State` and `Data` records, each with a timestamp in a common time domain for the whole file.
Typically, streams contain with one `Configuration` and one `State` record, followed one to millions of `Data` records.
* Records are structured as a succession of typed content blocks.
Typical content blocks are metadata, image, audio and custom content blocks.
* Metadata content blocks contain raw sensor data described once per stream, making the file format very efficient. The marginal cost of adding 1 byte of data to each metadata content block of a stream is 1 byte per record (or less, when lossless compression happens).
* Records can be losslessly compressed using lz4 or zstd, which are can be fast enough to do compress during recording.
* Multiple threads can create records concurrently for the same file.
* VRS supports huge file size (tested with multi terabytes use cases).
* VRS supports chunked files: auto-chunking on creation, automated chunk detection for playback.
* Playback is optimized for timestamp order (key for network streaming).
* Random-access playback is fully supported (in memory file and stream indexes).
* Customizable `FileHandler` support, to implement streaming from cloud storage (not provided yet).

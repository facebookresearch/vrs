VRS is a **file format** optimized to record and playback streams of sensor data, such as images, audio samples, and other discrete sensors (IMU, temperature, etc.), that are stored in per-device streams of time-stamped records.

VRS was first created to record images and sensor data from early prototypes of the Quest device, to develop the deviceâ€™s positional tracking system, now known as [Insight](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/powered-by-ai-oculus-insight/), and Quest's hand tracking software. VRS is also the file format used by the [Aria glasses](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/projectaria/).

## Main features
* VRS files contain multiple streams of time-sorted records generated by a set of *devices*, typically one set of *devices* per stream.
* A file and its streams contain a set of *tags*, which are string name/value pairs that describe them.
* Streams may contain `Configuration`, `State` and `Data` records, each with a timestamp in a common time domain for the whole file.
Typically, streams contain one `Configuration` record and one `State` record, followed by one to millions of `Data` records.
* Records are structured as a succession of typed content blocks.
Typically, content blocks are metadata, image, audio, and custom content blocks.
* Metadata content blocks contain raw sensor data described once per stream, making the file format very efficient. The marginal cost of adding 1 byte of data to each metadata content block in a stream is 1 byte per record (or less when lossless compression happens).
* Records can be losslessly compressed using lz4 or zstd, which are fast enough to do lossless compression during recording.
* Multiple threads can create records concurrently for the same file.
* VRS supports huge file sizes (tested with multi-terabyte use cases).
* VRS supports chunked files: auto-chunking on creation and automated chunk detection for playback.
* Playback is optimized for timestamp ordering, which is key for network streaming.
* Random-access playback is fully supported in memory files and stream indexes.
* Customizable `FileHandler` support to implement streaming from cloud storage is not currently provided.

# Pixi is a package management tool for developers.
# Before running a task, pixi ensures that all listed dependencies are installed first.
#
# Pixi is not required for VRS, but it is a convenient way to:
# - install the dependencies required for VRS
# - compile VRS and run its unit test
# in an isolated environment.
#
# https://pixi.sh/
#
# Use `pixi task list` to list the available tasks,
# and `pixi run build` to compile VRS.
